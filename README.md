## How to Use
1. Open Streamlabs Desktop
2. Right click on Follower Goal Widget
3. Click Properties
4. Set your current Goal Settings in the "Widget Editor" tab (title, current amt., goal, date)
5. MOST IMPORTANT: Set the Width/Height of the widget to be square values (ex. 200px by 200px - you can resize later on dashboard)
6. Click "HTML CSS" tab
7. Check "Enable Custom Code"
8. Enter HTML, CSS, and JS into corresponding sections
9. Done!

One small note: If it has been set a certain size in the properties (say 200x200) and you want to change it (say 400x400), it might not work at first, reload the widget and it will.

## Changing Colors
Super easy! Just edit the two values (--text-color and 3 --color-gradient-X) in the top (:root) section of the CSS!
